<h2 id="born">How was the idea born? <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h2>
<p>Most of the world’s population lives in cities today. This situation necessitates the development of cities according to current conditions. The era we live in is a period in which information and communication technologies, governance, entrepreneurship, prosperity, transparency, participatory culture, joint action with all segments of society and education are on the rise.1 Therefore, it has become a necessity to develop cities with these components. Otherwise, it can be said that they will not be able to provide sufficient progress to those living in cities. Smart cities emerge with the adaptation of cities to the period we are in. A smart city is a city that brings the living standards of its people to the highest possible level.</p>
 
<h2 id="components">Smart City Components2 <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h2>
<p>One of the most important components for a city to be a smart city is smart waste management.</p>
<h3 id="whatisit">What is Smart Waste Management? <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>Waste management in a city is the collection, transportation, separation, processing, recycling, reduction of emissions, conversion to energy, disposal and monitoring of waste materials and carrying out studies on the least pollution of the environment.3 In all these processes, it is aimed to carry out monitoring, measurement, and information processes with technology. Here, it is aimed to generate the least amount of waste and to use the resulting waste in the most effective way.
Solid wastes thrown from smart buildings and/or in the waste bin on a street are sorted through the underground system and sent to the final solid waste collection area.
That area called The Environmental Control Center carries out monitoring, supervision and management of all kinds of activities of vehicles that transport excavation, municipal waste, medical waste, industrial waste, marine waste and similar wastes, from the point where the waste is generated, until it is transferred to the facility where it will be disposed of.3 The system works by transmitting the information received by the devices attached to the vehicles from GPS satellites and sensors connected to the device to the center via GSM/GPRS, and the tracking, control and management of the vehicles are carried out instantly on the updated map. Thanks to the work of the Environmental Control Center, depending on the control of speed and route violations, the risk of traffic accidents is minimized, environmental pollution and illegal dumping violations are prevented, the monitoring and management of waste logistics is ensured, fuel and time savings are ensured, the control of truck entrances to heavy traffic areas by coordination with the urban traffic density and traffic possible reduce the burden.3
Waste management is also carried out to recover resources from it. Waste management can involve solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive substances, with different methods and fields of expertise for each.
Waste management practices differ for developed and developing nations, for urban and rural areas, and for residential and industrial producers. Management for non-hazardous waste residential and industrial waste in metropolitan areas is usually the responsibility of local government authorities, while management for non-hazardous commercial and industrial waste is usually the responsibility of the generator. 4</p>

<h2 id="sample">Sample components <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h2>
<h3 id="smartcont">Smart recycling container (PANT for plastic, metal, and glass waste) <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>With the system, it is aimed to develop a culture of recycling and to bring social responsibility and environmental awareness to citizens. Container can recognize glass and pet bottles, and metal boxes with image processing algorithms and barcode reading system.5 The machine can recognize and return not-empty bottles or different materials. The amount of waste thrown away is determined by the counter sensor, and the reward in the return can be loaded onto smart cards placed in the card reading chamber, and the cardholder can use it for shopping or in public transportation vehicles. By connecting to server system with the remote monitoring system, the number of wastes in the station, approximately percent occupancy rate, errors, location and working time can be monitored instantly over the internet and emptied when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="classification">Classification station <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>Solid waste and/or recyclables are classified into some categories.
•	Dry waste: waste which is produced and emitted for example from industrial plants, distribution centers, retail stores and manufacturers.
•	Wet waste: waste which is produced and emitted for example from grocery stores, food processors, restaurants, malls, and hospitals.
•	Bulky waste: for example, barrels, crates, drums, returned or changed goods, etc.
•	Recyclable materials: paper products, non-ferrous metals, plastics, etc.
Environmental Management Information System Center
Air quality monitoring, waste monitoring, noise monitoring, fuel control, vehicle tracking modules, etc. The system allows instant monitoring of pollution levels of different regions, visualization of environmental values, and the creation and use of pollution maps. The data in the system can be interrogated and analyzed by associating them with each other.</p>
<h3 id="zerowaste">Zero waste program <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>Cartridge-toner, fluorescent lamps, empty batteries, paper, glass and metal wastes were collected separately at the source by placing waste buckets for each type of waste in public buildings and communal living areas.</p>
<h3 id="burninghousehold">Burning household waste and <span style="background-color: yellow; color: red
;">energy</span> production from it <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>In this facility, the domestic waste collected from the city is separated and the part that can give energy when burned is taken. Energy is obtained by burning it. In this way, the energy will be saved, a significant part of the waste will be eliminated, and the co2 emissions will be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="energyfromgas">Energy Production from waste gas <small><sub><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></sub></small></h3>
<p>Waste gas, which consists of intelligently separated wastes, can be burned in a controlled manner, and used in energy production. In addition to the flammable and explosive properties of that gas, the methane in its content has 23 times more greenhouse gas effect in the atmosphere compared to CO2 gas, and in this way, carbon emissions are reduced.</p>
